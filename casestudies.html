                    <p data-lang-key="case1_p1"><strong>Situation:</strong> Tanaka-san (45) was diligently paying ¥30,000/month into a "savings-type" insurance policy, believing it was his primary retirement fund.</p>
                    <p data-lang-key="case1_p2"><strong>Revelation:</strong> Using our calculator, he discovered that after 20 years, his ¥7.2 million in payments would only be worth ¥7.5 million—a minuscule return. An investment plan could have reached over ¥15 million.</p>
                    <p data-lang-key="case1_p3"><strong>Outcome:</strong> He restructured his plan, buying cheaper term insurance for protection and investing the difference, doubling his potential retirement fund.</p>

                    <p data-lang-key="case2_p1"><strong>Situation:</strong> Sato-san (35) knew she should invest but kept saying "I'll do it someday."</p>
                    <p data-lang-key="case2_p2"><strong>Revelation:</strong> The interactive tool on our Investing page showed that starting at 35 vs. 30 would cost her over ¥10M in growth by age 65 due to lost compounding time.</p>
                    <p data-lang-key="case2_p3"><strong>Outcome:</strong> The shocking visual motivated her to start an automated monthly investment plan immediately.</p>

                    <p data-lang-key="case3_p1"><strong>Situation:</strong> John (42), a foreign resident, was worried about losing 15 years of pension payments when he planned to leave Japan.</p>
                    <p data-lang-key="case3_p2"><strong>Revelation:</strong> He learned about the Lump-sum Withdrawal was capped at 5 years and that he could access global investments from Japan.</p>
                    <p data-lang-key="case3_p3"><strong>Outcome:</strong> He started a portable investment plan, creating a nest egg independent of his residency status, giving him true financial freedom.</p>

                    <p data-lang-key="case4_p1"><strong>Situation:</strong> Suzuki-san (50) had ¥20 million saved in a major Japanese bank, feeling secure.</p>
                    <p data-lang-key="case4_p2"><strong>Revelation:</strong> She realized that with 2% inflation, her savings were losing ¥400,000 in purchasing power each year, while her 0.001% interest earned only ¥200. She was silently losing money.</p>
                    <p data-lang-key="case4_p3"><strong>Outcome:</strong> She moved a portion of her savings into a diversified, inflation-beating investment portfolio.</p>

                    <p data-lang-key="case5_p1"><strong>Situation:</strong> The Kimura couple felt overwhelmed and didn't know where to start with financial planning.</p>
                    <p data-lang-key="case5_p2"><strong>Revelation:</strong> The "Build Your House" analogy provided a clear, step-by-step framework: understand the foundation (pension), build the walls (investments), and protect it with a roof (proper insurance).</p>
                    <p data-lang-key="case5_p3"><strong>Outcome:</strong> They created their first-ever comprehensive financial plan, giving them immense peace of mind.</p>

                    <p data-lang-key="case6_p1"><strong>Situation:</strong> Watanabe-san (48) assumed his pension would be enough for his desired ¥300,000/month retirement lifestyle.</p>
                    <p data-lang-key="case6_p2"><strong>Revelation:</strong> The Retirement Calculator showed his estimated pension was only ¥180,000/month, leaving a ¥120,000 "gap." This meant he needed to accumulate a nest egg of ¥36 million to cover 25 years of retirement.</p>
                    <p data-lang-key="case6_p3"><strong>Outcome:</strong> With a clear target number, he created an aggressive savings and investment plan to bridge the gap.</p>

                    <p data-lang-key="case7_p1"><strong>Situation:</strong> A young couple bought a whole life insurance policy as their first "investment."</p>
                    <p data-lang-key="case7_p2"><strong>Revelation:</strong> They calculated that the cash value after 20 years would be less than what they paid in. The only way to "profit" was if one of them passed away early.</p>
                    <p data-lang-key="case7_p3"><strong>Outcome:</strong> They realized they were planning for death, not for life, and shifted their strategy to prioritize wealth building for their shared future.</p>

                    <p data-lang-key="case8_p1"><strong>Situation:</strong> A freelance designer (38) was only paying into the basic Kokumin Nenkin.</p>
                    <p data-lang-key="case8_p2"><strong>Revelation:</strong> The pension calculator showed her an estimated retirement income of only ~¥65,000/month. She had no company pension to supplement it.</p>
                    <p data-lang-key="case8_p3"><strong>Outcome:</strong> Realizing she was solely responsible for her retirement, she started using iDeCo for tax benefits and a separate investment account to build her "private pension."</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200">

                    <p data-lang-key="case9_p1"><strong>Situation:</strong> Ito-san opened a NISA account but was too scared to choose an investment, so the money just sat as cash.</p>
                    <p data-lang-key="case9_p2"><strong>Revelation:</strong> He learned that NISA is just a tax-free "container." The container is useless unless you fill it with assets that can actually grow.</p>
                    <p data-lang-key="case9_p3"><strong>Outcome:</strong> After attending a seminar to understand the basics of index funds, he finally invested his NISA contribution, turning the tax-free wrapper into a powerful growth tool.</p>

                <div class="card" data-aos="fade-up">
                    <h3 data-lang-key="case10_title">"From Gaman to Growth": Breaking the Cycle</h3>
                    <p data-lang-key="case10_p1"><strong>Situation:</strong> A family was stuck in the "gaman" mindset, enduring low bank interest because it felt "safe" and familiar.</p>
                    <p data-lang-key="case10_p2"><strong>Revelation:</strong> Seeing the "Three Coffee Shops" analogy made them realize their "safe" approach was actually a guaranteed loss against inflation. They were stuck as Shop B, not building a Shop C.</p>
                    <p data-lang-key="case10_p3"><strong>Outcome:</strong> They overcame their fear of the unknown and made their first strategic investment, breaking a generational cycle of financial inertia.</p>
